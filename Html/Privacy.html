                    smooth and customized experience. This allows us to provide
                    services and features that most likely meet your needs, and
                    to customize our Website to make your experience safer and
                    easier. More importantly, while doing so we collect personal
                    information from you that we consider necessary for

                <p>In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who
                    you are or revealing any personal information about
                    yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you
                    are not anonymous to us. Where possible, we indicate which
                    fields are required and which fields are optional. You
                    always have the option to not provide information by
                    choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the
                    Website. We may automatically track certain information
                    about you based upon your behaviour on our Website. We use
                    this information to do internal research on our users’
                    demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand,
                    protect and serve our users. This information is compiled
                    and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may
                    include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is
                    on our Website or not), which URL you next go to (whether
                    this URL is on our Website or not), your computer browser

                    effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. “Cookies” are
                    small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in
                    providing our services. We offer certain features that are

                    during a session. Cookies can also help us provide
                    information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies
                    are “session cookies”, meaning that they are automatically
                    deleted at the end of a session. You are always free to
                    decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in
                    that case you may not be able to use certain features on the
                    Website and you may be required to re-enter your password
                    more frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us
